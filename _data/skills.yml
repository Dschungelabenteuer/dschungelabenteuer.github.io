    description: "I have been passionate with web design and user interface since I was 9 years old.
    I think front-end development was not even a thing back then. You simply used to cut your image into
    pieces and integrate it into HTML and CSS and maybe use a bit of JavaScript. Old yet gold times! Now
    with the (r)evolution of JavaScript with things e.g. ECMAScript, libraries and frameworks, things
    sped up real fast (just look at how people often joke about the amount of new libraries emerging each day).
    It know gathers a whole set of skills and knowledge which can easily be a full-time occupation. To me, this
    is definitely one of the most interesting things on the internet since it brings together three major sides:
    <ul>
      <li>A <em>creative</em> one with User Interface</li>
      <li>A <em>social</em> one with the importance of User Experience and accessibility</li>
      <li>A <em>cognitive</em> one with all the thinking about architecture, scalability and performance</li>
    </ul>"

    description: Started as a kid when I was 10 playing around with PHP to make my own portfolio, creating new PHPBB and Wordpress modules
      for Forum-Toshop, one of the biggest french communities about Photoshop back then. It became quite serious at the university when I
      started building a platform for students to share recaps of lessons. I started learning about OOP, design patterns, and PHP Frameworks
      like Slim or CakePHP and was given the oppotunity to work with the University and the European <a href="http://www.otct-project.eu/fr/" title="OTCT Project website">OTCT project</a>.

  - label: CSS Methodologies
    description: "Because stylesheets also deserve to get good practices, to be maintanable and scalable!
    I'm mostly familiar with BEM, SMACSS and Atomic CSS. If you ever happen to work with me, you might
    find out that I kind of developped my own methodology over time and experience."

  - label: Design patterns
    description: "When I started working on real and big projects which require scalability and maintainability, I ineluctably ran
    into design patterns to solve different logical issues I could encounter. While I'm obviously really far away from knowing all of them,
    I'm quite familiar with the most popular ones such as MVC, Singleton, Factories, Adapters, etc."

  - label: Design systems
    description: "I have built my very first Design System as a side-project while working at BlueKanGo.
    While this is maybe one of the most time and effort consuming things, this is really satisfying. It brings
    a very strong foundation that infinitely makes life easier for developers. It gives quick access to
    ready-to-use components and global orientations in terms of User Experience, User Interface and company strategies.
    It might also raise your pairs' awareness about things like accessibility, workflows, QA, etc. I strongly believe
    that every big modern web application should come with its own Design System."

    description: "I have experienced building Progressive Web Apps with some side projects.
    I know how to set up a service worker to e.g. provide an offline access to an application. I know
    how to define different cache strategies to achieve specific targets. While working at BlueKanGo,
    I was responsible for the upgrade of our offline-first application from the deprecated AppCache
    technology to the use of a Service Worker."
